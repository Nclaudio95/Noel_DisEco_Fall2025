**Image description:** The image represents the Disease triad or Disease triangle. It shows the influence of the environment with the pathogen and the host and helps us understand what factors are needed for successful pathogen infection. It can also help predict disease outcome.

**Worksheet #2 (September 22, 2025)**

![](images/clipboard-3939533899.png)

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

The sample size necessary needed to detect disease is **59.**

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

sample size needed is **299**

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

Sample size needed is **229**

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is\
\
Using Rule of 3 (3/n)

n= 300 animals sampled

3/300 animals sampled from the herd = **0.01** or **1%.**

I'm 95% confident that the prevalence of EHD is **1%.**
