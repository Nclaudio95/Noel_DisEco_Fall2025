**Worksheet #2 (September 22, 2025)**

![](images/clipboard-3939533899.png)

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

The sample size necessary needed to detect disease is **59.**

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

sample size needed is **299**

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

Sample size needed is **229**

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is\
\
Using Rule of 3 (3/n)

n= 300 animals sampled

3/300 animals sampled from the herd = **0.01** or **1%.**

I'm 95% confident that the prevalence of EHD is **1%.**

**Worksheet #3**

Oct-7-25

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10^th^ June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

![](images/clipboard-1916663036.png){width="514"}

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

Show your work.

**a) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.** (9 points)

**06/12/25**\
Since the beginning of the study until 06/12/25 there were 5 new cases of conjunctivitis.

Calculation 5/51x100= **0.09 or 9.80% cases per elk-day.**

**06/14/25/25**

On this date 2 new cases appeared of conjunctivitis

Calculation 2/44x100= **0.045% or 4.5% cases per elk-day**

**06/15/25**

On this date 0 new cases were registered of conjuctivitis

Calculation 0/42x100= **0% cases per elk-day**

**b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.** (5 points)

**The prevalence for 06/13/25**

Cumulative cases 12

Total population 56

Calculation\
\
12/56x100= **21.42%**

**The prevalence for 06/16/25**

Cumulative 5 (because 9 animals recovered)

Total population 56\

5/56x100= **8.92%**

**c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)? (3 points)**

**On 06/10/25 the incidence and prevalence are the same.**

The was a report with 1 infected animal. For incidence 1/55x100= **1.88%** cases per elk-day and prevalence was 1/56X100= **1.78** which can be rounded to **1.8%.**

**d) On which day is the incidence lowest?  (3 points)**

On **06/15/25** the incidence was the lowest cause there was 0 reported new cases of conjunctivitis. Followed by **06/16/25** which also had 0 new cases. They both had an incidence of 0%.

**Tick Identification Lab (October 8, 2025)**

In the first part of the lab, we examined different life stages of lone star ticks by counting the number of legs given that they're arachnids. One specimen had six legs, identifying it as a larva, while two specimens had eight legs, this indicated they were either nymphs or adults. In the second part, we differentiated male and female lone star ticks based on the scutum's appearance. The male was shinier and displayed a distinct white splotch or star, whereas the female had a softer appearance with visible lines on the scutum. The bottom specimen was identified as the male and the top specimen as the female.

For the third slide, we focused on determining the genus by observing the position of the anal groove. The anal groove was anterior to the anus, the specimen was identified as *Ixodes scapularis*. Both ticks were adults, and the left specimen was larger with a clearly visible anal groove. In the final observation, we examined a tick with eight legs and a central genital pore, confirming it was in its adult stage. The absence of an anterior anal groove, along with long mouthparts and an ornate scutum, led to its identification as Gulf Coast tick, specifically an adult male.

**Make up midterm exam questions (Oct 15,2025)\
\
Question 9.** Define R0. Estimate the R0 for the following scenario. Red flamingo represents and infectious case, and blue are susceptible: an arrow indicates transmission. Explain your findings in the context of real-world utility of R0.

**Scenario 1.** R0=1

**Scenario 2.** R0= 3

**Scenario 3.** R0=2

**Scenario 4.** R0=0

Calculating the R0.

R0= 1+3+2+0 new cases/ 4 infected individuals= 6/4= **1.5**

R0=**1.5**

**Explanation:** Since the R0 is higher than one we can estimate that this infection could keep spreading. This means that 1 infected individual could infect in theory 1.5 individuals and an outbreak can occur.

**Question 10.** Steve studies a population of the Swannee Alligator snapping turtle (macrochelys suwanniensis) in Florida. He has been conducting a mark-recapture study of this population since 2010. Since 2015, he has documented cases of cutaneous fibroma in this population. The following data was collected by Steve:\
\

| Year | Population Estimate | Turtle with Fibroma: Old cases | Turtles with Fibroma: New cases |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 2015 | 133 | 0 | 4 |
| 2016 | 125 | 2 | 5 |
| 2017 | 112 | 4 | 8 |
| 2018 | 145 | 5 | 4 |
| 2019 | 136 | 4 | 2 |
|  |  |  |  |

Worksheet #4 October 23,2025

**MERS-CoV**

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels (dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.

Worksheet 6: Using QPweb (Quantitative Parasitology) 10 points

\
A new disease, Vertico, has been detected in fish in two separate ponds. Your task is to analyze the sample data to determine and compare the disease prevalence between the two ponds.

\
Instructions:\
1. Determine Prevalence\
a. Use the online tool QPweb to calculate the prevalence of Vertico in each\
pond.\
b. Report the prevalence as a percentage (e.g., 0.35 → 35%).

**Pond 1 ( 30% prevalence for vertico)**

**Pond 2 (6.7% prevalence for vertico)**

\
2. Calculate the 95% Confidence Interval (CI)\
a. Use QPweb to calculate the 95% CI for each prevalence estimate.

**Pond 1 (Lower 0.140 (14%) and Upper 0.525 (53%))**

**Pond 2 (Lower 0.003 (0.3%) and Upper 0.302 (32%))**

\
b. Report the CI values as percentages, rounded meaningfully (e.g., 0.057\
→ 6%).

**Pond 1 (Lower 14% and Upper 53%)**

**Pond 2 (Lower 0.3% and Upper 32%)**

\
3. Compare Prevalence Between the Two Ponds

**Pond 1 has a higher prevalence 30% than pond 2 with 6.7%.**

\
a. Perform a Fisher’s exact test to compare the two prevalence values.

\
b. Report the p-value.

**The p-value according to Fishers exact test was 0.1987**

\
c. State whether the difference is statistically significant. i. If p \< 0.05, the difference is statistically significant.

**Not statistically significant. Meaning that there is not statistical difference between both ponds for vertico.**

\
Deliverables:\
For each pond, report the following:\
• Prevalence (%)\
• 95% CI (%)\
• Fisher’s exact test p-value\
• Interpretation (Is the difference statistically significant?)\
