**Worksheet #3**

Oct-7-25

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10^th^ June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

![](images/clipboard-1916663036.png){width="514"}

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

Show your work.

**a) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.** (9 points)

**06/12/25**\
Since the beginning of the study until 06/12/25 there were 5 new cases of conjunctivitis.

Calculation 5/51x100= **0.09 or 9.80% cases per elk-day.**

**06/14/25/25**

On this date 2 new cases appeared of conjunctivitis

Calculation 2/44x100= **0.045% or 4.5% cases per elk-day**

**06/15/25**

On this date 0 new cases were registered of conjuctivitis

Calculation 0/42x100= **0% cases per elk-day**

**b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.** (5 points)

**The prevalence for 06/13/25**

Cumulative cases 12

Total population 56

Calculation\
\
12/56x100= **21.42%**

**The prevalence for 06/16/25**

Cumulative 5 (because 9 animals recovered)

Total population 56\

5/56x100= **8.92%**

**c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)? (3 points)**

**On 06/10/25 the incidence and prevalence are the same.**

The was a report with 1 infected animal. For incidence 1/55x100= **1.88%** cases per elk-day and prevalence was 1/56X100= **1.78** which can be rounded to **1.8%.**

**d) On which day is the incidence lowest?  (3 points)**

On **06/15/25** the incidence was the lowest cause there was 0 reported new cases of conjunctivitis. Followed by **06/16/25** which also had 0 new cases. They both had an incidence of 0%.

**Tick Identification Lab (October 8, 2025)**

In the first part of the lab, we examined different life stages of lone star ticks by counting the number of legs given that they're arachnids. One specimen had six legs, identifying it as a larva, while two specimens had eight legs, this indicated they were either nymphs or adults. In the second part, we differentiated male and female lone star ticks based on the scutum's appearance. The male was shinier and displayed a distinct white splotch or star, whereas the female had a softer appearance with visible lines on the scutum. The bottom specimen was identified as the male and the top specimen as the female.

For the third slide, we focused on determining the genus by observing the position of the anal groove. The anal groove was anterior to the anus, the specimen was identified as *Ixodes scapularis*. Both ticks were adults, and the left specimen was larger with a clearly visible anal groove. In the final observation, we examined a tick with eight legs and a central genital pore, confirming it was in its adult stage. The absence of an anterior anal groove, along with long mouthparts and an ornate scutum, led to its identification as Gulf Coast tick, specifically an adult male.

**Make up midterm exam questions (Oct 15,2025)\
\
Question 9.** Define R0. Estimate the R0 for the following scenario. Red flamingo represents and infectious case, and blue are susceptible: an arrow indicates transmission. Explain your findings in the context of real-world utility of R0.

**Scenario 1.** R0=1

**Scenario 2.** R0= 3

**Scenario 3.** R0=2

**Scenario 4.** R0=0

Calculating the R0.

R0= 1+3+2+0 new cases/ 4 infected individuals= 6/4= **1.5**

R0=**1.5**

**Explanation:** Since the R0 is higher than one we can estimate that this infection could keep spreading. This means that 1 infected individual could infect in theory 1.5 individuals and an outbreak can occur.

**Question 10.** Steve studies a population of the Swannee Alligator snapping turtle (macrochelys suwanniensis) in Florida.

Worksheet #4 October 23,2025

**MERS-CoV**

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels (dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.

**Worksheet #7**

**1-** Nipah Virus Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive measures recommended in each setting. **8 points**

**Malaysia:** happened because of the intermediate host which are pigs who got infected from fruit bats. Prevention is mainly biosecurity of pig farms limiting the interaction of bats with pigs.

**Bangladesh:** happened during the harvesting of date palm sap with cases being from eating the raw sap. Discouraging the bats from consuming the sap using covers.

They differ in the way people got infected. Even though both are caused by bats on is through "food" and the other is through the pig.

**2-** Avian Reovirus Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes? Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe its impact on the affected population. **6 points**

**Transmission routes:** Fecal-oral,contaminated water with feces, aerosolized particles, direct contact with infected flock or birds and transovarial from the bird to the egg.

**Environmental factors:** Bird density (crowding increases chance of infection), fomites (any tool used in the bird management), poor litter management. Pathogen is environmentally stable meaning it can persist in contaminated litter.

**Example:** Winter die-off of crows in North America

**3-** Langya henipavirus Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China. Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV classified as a spillover and not a potential EID? **6 points**

The likely reservoir for this virus is a shrew. Transmission is likely direct and indirect contact with the animal itself either with feces or contaminated food. The cases are locally in China and are sporadic so its considered a spillover to humans but the virus is not currently evolving for human to human adaptation.

**Worksheet #8**

30 points

The data you will examine for this worksheet assignment is real. It derives from an examination of raccoon roundworm (*Baylisascaris procyonis*), a nematode worm found in the course of necropsies of 61 raccoons collected in Missouri and Arkansas during 2013 and 2014.

Download data (WS7_data.csv) from my Github repository: <https://github.com/anyadoc/audiseco/blob/main/WS7_data.csv>

Some background on *B. procyonis*:

-   Raccoons are definitive hosts.

-   Adult worms reside in the raccoon intestine where they lay eggs which pass out of the host in the feces. These eggs may then be transmitted to other raccoons or to non-raccoon hosts.

-   In paratenic or accidental hosts (including humans), eggs hatch to larvae, and larval stages of the nematode migrate, and cause damage to nervous-system tissues, resulting in morbidity & mortality. See e.g.: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3285578.pdf>

-   As a risk to humans, wildlife, and domestic animals there is a need to better understand the ecology of this parasite

The dataset is comprised of information collected on 61 raccoons, each of which was necropsied and the number of roundworms counted. For each host there is data on the date of capture, the region (North, Central and South), the sex (male, female) and the age (adult, young adult). The last column gives the number of worms found during necropsy. Zero (0) worms indicates the raccoon was not found to be infected. Note that the necropsy data is real.

You have to analyze and summarize this data. Identify the patterns that emerge and use the available data to explain the patterns. Analyze this dataset to determine prevalence patterns and perform meaningful comparisons between different groups. For example, you can compare prevalence of *B. procyonis* between the three regions, between males and females in each region, between age classes in each region, etc. Please show your work, use Quantitative Parasitology for your calculations and comparisons. Provide confidence intervals for prevalence estimates. Finally, explain your analysis of this real-world data.

Refer to the PDF document available on QPweb titled **“How to Organize a Data Set: Essentials Before Upload.”**

**Analysis Based on sex**

The prevalence of *B. procyonis* in Females was **0.649** with 24 having tested positive for the parasite in a population of 37 females. Confidence intervals ( Lower **0.486** Upper **0.786**).

The prevalence of *B. procyonis* was **0.377** with 26 having tested positive for the parasite in a population of 69 males. Confidence intervals ( Lower **0.267** Upper **0.500**).

**Concluding remark:** Females presented a higher prevalence of the parasite when compared to their male counterparts with a prevalence of **0.649.** When comparing both females with males there was a trend of higher counts of the parasite in females. Interestingly on other sources it is stated that male raccoons tend to be more prone to the parasite than the females but it depends on the season and behavioral differences based on sex. February also had higher numbers.

**Woksheet #9**

**1.** In 2024, a multistate Salmonella outbreak was linked to backyard poultry flocks in the  United States. What specific human behaviors contributed to the zoonotic spread of *Salmonella*? In your response, identify at least three practices by backyard poultry owners that increased the risk of Salmonella transmission, and briefly explain why these behaviors facilitated human infection. **10 points**

1- **Cuddling with the chicken as they are considered pets, Salmonella could be spreaded through the feathers, droppings or the dust.**

**2- Close contact with the chickens in living spaces.**

**3- Fomites like footwear could carry Salmonella and infected people.**

2\. Tall fescue grass is commonly infected with a fungal endophyte (*Epichloë coenophiala*) that produces ergot alkaloids associated with fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock.

a\. What advantage does Tall fescue gain from being infected with a fungal endophyte? **3 points**

**improved drought tolerance, resistance to herbivory**

b.What environmental and ecological factors drive the occurrence and severity of fescue toxicosis in grazing systems? **4 points**

**Hight temperatures cause the production of alkaloids, soil ecology including the microbiome affect the expression of the endophyte and overgrazing forces cattle to consume alkaloid containing stems.**

c\. What are the key clinical signs of fescue toxicity in cattle?

**Weight loss, rough and discolored hair and fescue foot**\

**Worksheet #10**

1.What are the different routes of transmission for African Swine fever? What role do humans play in the spread and transmission of ASF? **10 points**

**Vector borne ( *Ornithodoros Tick),* direct contact with the infected pig ( bodily fluids like saliva and blood, Contaminated feed, mechanical vectors like fomites**.

2\. Describe how co-infection with Koala retrovirus (KoRV) affects the severity, progression, and management of Chlamydia in koalas. **10 points**

**The infection with this virus attacks the inmune system making the koala more prevalent for Chlamydial infections. Co-infection with it also increases the mortality and infertility rate in koalas. A compromised inmune system with an HIV like virus gives an opportunistic advantage to Chlamydia to increase its severity making the treatment with antibiotic close to impossible to work.**

3\. Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), caused by *Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola*, is an emerging threat to wild snake populations in North America.

What are the key challenges associated with the surveillance and management of Snake Fungal Disease (SFD)? **10 points**

**Due to snakes being secretive in nature surveillance is complicated, the fungus has a relatively wide host range ranging from docile cornsnakes to rattlesnakes making the infection dynamics somewhat complex. Although this fungus causes lesions they may overlap with other injuries but other signs like crusty eyes and facial swelling. Antifungal treatment and delivery method for large populations is unavailable at the moment making management and surveillance difficult.**\

**Final Exam. December 4th, 2025**

 **1**. True or False. If false, explain why the statement is incorrect (**10 points**) 

a\. Per the community–epidemiology continuum proposed by Fenton and Pedersen (2005), a disease caused by a pathogen with high between-species transmission and no within–target species transmission will be termed a spillover. 

**True**

b. A viral disease that is transmitted to susceptible hosts only by vectors is infectious as well as contagious. 

**False A disease transmitted only by vectors is infectious but not contagious. In order to be contagious direct transmission between hosts is required.**

c\. The eggs of *Baylisascaris procyonis* can be transmitted to humans by direct contact immediately after excretion by an infected raccoon. 

**False. *Baylisascaris procyonis* eggs are not infectious after excretion. The eggs require 2–4 weeks in order to be infectious.**

d. A fungus growing on tall fescue leaves is responsible for decreased feed intake in cattle grazing on this grass, resulting in reduced weight gain and lower milk production. 

**True**

e. Northern cardinals are considered superspreaders species for West Nile virus. 

**False, the American Robin is the bird species considered to be a super spreader.**

2. List the community-based interventions used for preventing dracunculiasis transmission in endemic regions. Explain how each intervention interrupts specific stages of the Guinea worm life cycle. How have these strategies evolved in recent years given the emergence of animal (particularly dog) infections? (**10 points**)

**Answer question 2:**

**1- Using some sort of filtration to filter the water keeps the third larvae stage from entering the body by drinking water.**

**2- Chemical treatment of the water with ABATE is a larvicide and its also toxic to the copepod which is the intermediate host.**
**3- Protection of the well water**

**4- Preventing infected people from coming in contact with water, the parasite creates a blister on the lower limbs that releases the larvae in to the water.**

**5- Educating about the importance of safe water drinking**

**6- Tethering dogs to prevent them from eating contaminated fish or entering the water if they are infected.**

3. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging prion disease of cervids and one of the most significant wildlife conservation challenges in North America. What are the main obstacles wildlife agencies face in managing and controlling CWD? (**10 points)**

**Answer for question 3: CWD is caused by a prion which is a biologically important protein that has been misfolded and becomes highly infectious. Due to the fact that its a misfolded protein it can withstand sterilization that would normally render a normal folded protein biologically useless. Main obstacles wildlife agencies are facing are that its a protein with the ability of efficient horizontal transmission and it can persist in the environment.**

**There is currently no vaccination against CWD and no treatment for it. Infected individuals are difficult to detect and once its established its difficult to eliminate. Management tools are spread control are currently limited.**

d. The natural reservoir and competent hosts of *Borrelia burgdorferi* in North America: **White footed mouse**. White-tailed deer are the preferred **host** in the Lyme disease system. 

8. Georgia has a white-tailed deer population of \~ **1 million**. A total of **1351** samples from hunter-harvested deer were tested for Chronic Wasting Disease in 2022. None of the samples tested positive for CWD. Using the hypergeometric distribution, Georgia DNR determines that CWD is not present above **0.2%** prevalence in Georgia’s white-tailed deer population. You are asked to comment on Georgia DNR’s CWD surveillance approach. In your commentary, explain the downside of using hypergeometric distribution for making decisions about wildlife disease surveillance. (**10 points**)

**Answer:**

**The hypergeometric distribution (Cannon & Roe 1982) as discussed in class is used to determine the sample size needed to be sampled to detect a specific disease.**

**My comment would be "The downside to this is that it assumes a perfect detection and controlled sampling with a finite population, the sampling was not random because the samples were from harvested deer which hunters pick out out of preference. Random sampling and a bigger sample size is needed to make a more accurate conclusion on whether CWD is present in white tail deer population."**

Place the following diseases in appropriate quadrants in the above figure. Explain your choice of quadrants. (**10 points**) 

**Answers for question 9**

a\. **SARS-CoV-2-Potential Emerging Infectious disease, A case of spillover that is currently maintained within humans. (Quadrant 1 spillover)**

**b. Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome- Apparent multihost pathogen. It has multiple hosts that can be infected (primarily rodents) and some other animals but it cant be passed to humans only rodents can. (Quadrant 2 Apparent multihost)**

**c. Langya Henipavirus - apparent multihost pathogen. Its primary host is the shrew but it has been found in cases in other animals like dogs and goats. The virus could also be considered a Potential EID cause some rare cases have been described of human to human. (Quadrant 4 Potential EID)**

**d. Brucellosis- true multihost pathogen because it can be found in bison, cattle and elk (Quadrant 3 True Multihost)**

**e. West Nile virus- Spillover, this pathogen moved from birds to humans. (Quadrant 1 Spillover)**

10\. Anisakiasis is the disease caused by infection with the stomach worm *Anisakis simplex*. It reaches sexual maturity and reproduces in marine mammals. In the following figure, identify the definitive host, a dead-end host, a paratenic host, and an intermediate host. Explain your answers. (**8 points**) 

![](images/clipboard-3085602545.png)
**Answer for question 10**

**Definitive host: Marine mammals, the mammal ingest the infected crustacean or fish and the parasite reproduces. The mammal sheds the eggs into the water in whihc they molt, hatch and the larvae infects the crustacean.**

**Dead-end host: Humans, can become infected but the worm is not able to reproduce.**

**Paratenic host: sea fish and cephalopods, can carry the parasite but in the life cycle is not visible that the parasite is able to reproduce.**

**Intermediate host: crustaceans, carry the L3 free living larvae**

11\. All infected hosts are diseased. Comment using appropriate examples. (**3 points**) 

**Answer question 11:** **False, some host may be infected but not diseased. Some animal acts as reservoirs to keep the pathogen in circulation in the environment. Example: Lyme** **disease, mice can get infected with Borrelia but nor be diseased. Water fowl can also be another example. They act as reservoirs for the virus but do not present disease. Contrasting this, poultry can become diseased from the virus.**



12. Klepac et al. estimated an R0 of 2.5 for the 2002 Phocine Distemper virus epidemic in Dutch harbor seals. Assuming that an effective PDV vaccine is available, what proportion of the seal population should be vaccinated to prevent a future outbreak of PDV? (**3 points**) 

Data:

R0: 2.5

1/R0 is the threshold for an outbreak to occur

1/2.5= 0.4

**Equation of herd immunity: 1-1/R0**

**Answer: 1-1/2.5= 0.6 or 60% of the population of seals needs to be vaccinated against Phocine Distemper Virus to prevent an outbreak.**

13. What are some of the main challenges in managing wildlife diseases? Explain using relevant examples. (**6 points**)

**Answer for question 13: Wildlife is widespread so managing diseases becomes difficult. Animals natural behavior ( snake fungal disease) the snakes secretive nature makes it difficult for surveillance. The environment also plays a factor in how the disease interacts with the host ( *Pasteurella* with Saiga antelope), Hanta virus and El Nino 1992 created a population density increase. Possibility and unpredictability of spillover into susceptible species (Covid-19)**
