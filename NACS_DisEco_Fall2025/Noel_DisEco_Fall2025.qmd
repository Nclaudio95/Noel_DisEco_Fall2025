**Worksheet #2 (September 22, 2025)**

![](images/clipboard-3939533899.png)

1\) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

The sample size necessary needed to detect disease is **59.**

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

a\) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

sample size needed is **299**

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

Sample size needed is **229**

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is\
\
Using Rule of 3 (3/n)

n= 300 animals sampled

3/300 animals sampled from the herd = **0.01** or **1%.**

I'm 95% confident that the prevalence of EHD is **1%.**

**Worksheet #3**

Oct-7-25

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10^th^ June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

RE: red eyes; OD: ocular discharge; NAD: no abnormality detected

![](images/clipboard-1916663036.png){width="514"}

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

Show your work.

**a) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. Write the unit for incidence.** (9 points)

**06/12/25**\
Since the beginning of the study until 06/12/25 there were 5 new cases of conjunctivitis.

Calculation 5/51x100= **0.09 or 9.80% cases per elk-day.**

**06/14/25/25**

On this date 2 new cases appeared of conjunctivitis

Calculation 2/44x100= **0.045% or 4.5% cases per elk-day**

**06/15/25**

On this date 0 new cases were registered of conjuctivitis

Calculation 0/42x100= **0% cases per elk-day**

**b) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.** (5 points)

**The prevalence for 06/13/25**

Cumulative cases 12

Total population 56

Calculation\
\
12/56x100= **21.42%**

**The prevalence for 06/16/25**

Cumulative 5 (because 9 animals recovered)

Total population 56\

5/56x100= **8.92%**

**c) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)? (3 points)**

**On 06/10/25 the incidence and prevalence are the same.**

The was a report with 1 infected animal. For incidence 1/55x100= **1.88%** cases per elk-day and prevalence was 1/56X100= **1.78** which can be rounded to **1.8%.**

**d) On which day is the incidence lowest?  (3 points)**

On **06/15/25** the incidence was the lowest cause there was 0 reported new cases of conjunctivitis. Followed by **06/16/25** which also had 0 new cases. They both had an incidence of 0%.

**Tick Identification Lab (October 8, 2025)**

In the first part of the lab, we examined different life stages of lone star ticks by counting the number of legs given that they're arachnids. One specimen had six legs, identifying it as a larva, while two specimens had eight legs, this indicated they were either nymphs or adults. In the second part, we differentiated male and female lone star ticks based on the scutum's appearance. The male was shinier and displayed a distinct white splotch or star, whereas the female had a softer appearance with visible lines on the scutum. The bottom specimen was identified as the male and the top specimen as the female.

For the third slide, we focused on determining the genus by observing the position of the anal groove. The anal groove was anterior to the anus, the specimen was identified as *Ixodes scapularis*. Both ticks were adults, and the left specimen was larger with a clearly visible anal groove. In the final observation, we examined a tick with eight legs and a central genital pore, confirming it was in its adult stage. The absence of an anterior anal groove, along with long mouthparts and an ornate scutum, led to its identification as Gulf Coast tick, specifically an adult male.
